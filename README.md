# R-factor
Rainfall erosivity, often denoted as the R-factor, is one of the most critical factors influencing erosion processes. Estimating the R-factor from high-resolution satellite and reanalysis datasets requires the identification of erosive events and subsequent computation of erosivity for each time interval.
The MATLAB code provided in this repository effectively computes rainfall erosivity values for each grid using 30-minute and 60-minute rainfall data. However, users are requested to first prepare all datasets in array format before utilizing the MATLAB function to estimate rainfall erosivity.
